# Findings

## Repository

- Remote repository cloned successfully on June 19, 2026.
- Repository was empty.
- Bundled Godot executable is available at `../Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`.
- Installed version is Godot 4.6.3 stable.

## Approved Design

- 2D top-down pixel art inspired by Enter the Gungeon's readability and animation energy.
- 640x360 internal canvas.
- 32x32 logical tiles.
- Player moves one cardinal cell per input.
- Sword damages one adjacent facing cell.
- Vertical slice eventually includes Black Pawn AI, Knight AI, Place Block, and Knight Captain.

## Architecture

- `GridWorld` owns logical cells and reservations.
- Actors request moves; they do not infer collision from sprite overlap.
- Combat captures a target cell and resolves once on the impact frame.
- Presentation can change independently from cell logic.

## Playtest Feedback

- Current 0.18-second stepping feels right.
- Held directional movement should remain enabled.
- Sword response feels right.
- The player needs `Shift + direction` turning without movement.
- Basic attack range can remain one cell, while weapons and skills provide future range variation.
- Approved slice loadout: Wooden Sword plus Pencil Thrust.
